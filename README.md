# Dental Implant Classification from Radiographic Images
## Comprehensive Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Overview

This report outlines a comprehensive plan for developing a machine learning system to classify dental implant brands and models from radiographic images (periapical and panoramic X-rays). With a combined dataset of 12,000-15,000 images, we aim to build both transfer learning and custom deep learning models to achieve optimal classification accuracy.

### 2. Dataset Preparation

#### 2.1 Data Collection and Organization
- **Source Integration**: Combined multiple datasets into a unified structure under `data/data_raw`
- **Class Distribution Analysis**: Implemented statistical tracking of class distributions
- **Data Partitioning**: Split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets with consistent class representation
- **Duplicate Detection**: Implemented perceptual hash-based duplicate identification with dental-specific parameters
- **Storage Structure**: Organized processed data into class-specific directories within train/val/test splits

#### 2.2 Preprocessing Pipeline Implementation
The `data_process.py` script implements a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline:

1. **Image Loading**: Handles various input formats with error detection and reporting
2. **Quality Assessment**: Validates images and skips corrupted files
3. **Duplicate Removal**: Uses perceptual hashing with a hash size of 12 for dental X-ray specific duplicate detection
4. **Size Normalization**: Resizes to 512×512 pixels while preserving aspect ratio through padding
5. **Contrast Enhancement**: Applies CLAHE with customized parameters for dental radiographs
6. **Noise Reduction**: Implements bilateral filtering to preserve edge details of implants
7. **Edge Enhancement**: Applies adaptive sharpening to highlight implant boundaries
8. **Normalization**: Scales pixel values appropriately for model input
9. **Debug Capability**: Optional debug mode saves intermediate processing steps for quality verification

#### 2.3 Data Augmentation Strategy (Planned for Training Phase)
The following augmentation techniques will be implemented during model training to improve generalization and robustness:

- **Geometric Transformations**:
  - Rotation (±15°) - Accounts for variable implant orientations in radiographs
  - Width/height shifts (±10%) - Simulates different implant positions
  - Zoom range (0.9-1.1) - Handles variable magnification factors
  - Horizontal flips - Increases dataset diversity

- **Intensity Adjustments**:
  - Brightness variation (±10%) - Simulates different exposure settings
  - Contrast adjustment (0.8-1.2) - Accounts for radiograph quality variations
  - Simulated noise addition - Improves robustness to image noise

- **Domain-Specific Augmentations**:
  - Simulated exposure variations - Mirrors different X-ray machine settings
  - Bone density variations - Accounts for patient anatomical differences
  - Metal artifact simulation - Helps model recognize implants despite common artifacts

Note: These augmentations will be implemented using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator during the model training phase, not in the preprocessing pipeline.

### 3. Transfer Learning Implementation
